Give the same input gets the same outputs
if we call a function 10 times we get the same result
thats pure 
but if we gets the different result every time we gives the input 
thats impure
React also works on the same concept
like 
we give a same props and gets the same jsx 
due to performance reason 

How do we keep it pure 
use any variable and updation inside the component 
keep the variable away from rendering phase
